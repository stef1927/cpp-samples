===========

Some C++ samples that I wrote to familiarize with C++ 11 features.

Each file builds independently using g++ -static -std=c++11 - I used version 4.8.1.

* Reverse Polish Calculator is a basic but extensible RPN calculator (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

* Matrix is a matrix that can be transposed or rotated by 90 degrees.

* Reverse linked list is a single linked list that can be reversed using recursion (the iterative code is commented out).

* Stacks is a stack implemented using an underlying a set of stacks.
